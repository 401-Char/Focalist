## Team Members

## Project Description

This is a web application that users can add their todos things in the future and the app will send reminders via text messages. The app will be configurable in that users can choose the format and time of the reminder messages. 

# User Stories
### Resource followed for creating these user stories: 
https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/projects/

## 28-yo Professional Identifying as Female:
As a busy professional, I want an app that helps me plan my day, so I don’t miss important events. I want to be able to see the activities I have to do, add an activity, and receive a reminder text of that activity, so I don’t forget that I have to do that activity.

### Feature Tasks:
* Save event to list of events
* Show list of activities for that particular user
* Text user of event she has scheduled, prior to the event occurring

### Acceptance Tests:
* Ensure that the user can add an event into her list of events
* Ensure that the event successfully saves into database
* Provide error messages if system becomes unavailable
* Ensure the text message is successfully sent to the user

## 88-yo Retiree Identifying as Male:
As an active gentleman, I want an app that is easy and intuitive to use, that allows me to remember to take my medications and vitamins. I have lots of medicines to take every day, at different times, so this will help keep me healthy. I need an app that I can trust and that is easy to use and intuitive

### Feature Tasks:
* Save a task such as a medication and time, that a user can type in manually, (so as to differentiate between medications the user has to take), to his list of tasks.
* UI must be simple and intuitive, with minimal steps to complete in order to receive a reminder.
* Build an app that reliably sends out reminders.

### Acceptance Tests:
* Ensure that the user can add a task that he can input to his liking (ie, “Take Lipitor”)
* Ensure that users with little tech experience can easily login, effortlessly add a task they wish to be reminded of, and then receive a text alert. 

## 19-yo College Student Identifying as Female:
As a college student, I want an app I can rely on to remind me of when my classes start every day. While I want to add to my scheduled events something like, “go to class,” and then get a text message before class, I specifically want an app with a cool modern look, so I can show it off to my friends. 

### Feature Tasks:
* Design a modern UI 
* Remind the user in the web app to make sure they can hear the alerts from text messages.

### Acceptance Tests:
* Ensure there is documentation available for the user on the website that reminds her that her phone must be set to notify her appropriately of text message reminders from our system (as in, do not activate “do not disturb” during the times she wishes to get notifications.
* Users must be pleased with the UI that we create.

## 29-yo Software Developer Identifying as Male:
As an extremely busy software developer currently in a software development bootcamp, I want to easily set up due dates for project deadlines, with my notes for those deadlines, and then to be texted by a program to remind me of those projects and notes. This is to help me stay organized and on top of my projects.

### Feature Tasks:
* The app must allow many to-do items each day from each user.
* The user should be able to enter notes associated with each item, that are texted to the user along with the task title. 
* Make sure there is documentation in the website that tells the user that they are responsible for any charges associated with texting, given the likelihood of a high number of reminder texts and larger size of texts if the notes section is employed. 
* The UI should be clean and modern
* The app should have secure login, so it cannot be easily hacked.

### Acceptance Tests:
* Ensure the app can process numerous to-do items from the user appropriately.
* Ensure that text messages include the task title and notes (and location as appropriate), of the to-do item.
* Check that the website has documentation regarding the higher number of text messages and potentially larger size of texts that may be received.
* Tech-savvy users should enjoy using the app

## 36-yo Stay-At-Home Mom, Identifying as Female:
As a busy mother of three, I want my children who have cell phones to receive text message reminders that I can set up for them through accounts I set up for them through FocalList. This way, my children can be reminded of things they have to do, without me having to text or call them every moment of the day.

### Feature Tasks:
* Account setup is quick and easy for a user, so that a user who has to set up multiple accounts is satisfied with her experience.
* Adding to-do tasks is very easy and quick, so that when there are multiple tasks to add to the user’s list, it takes minimal time to do so. 

### Acceptance Tests:
* Ensure that account setup takes less than 2 minutes.
* Ensure that adding a task is a quick and simple process.
